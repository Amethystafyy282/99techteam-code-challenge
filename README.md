# 99TechTeam Code Challenge

I want to thank the team for creating a really amazing challenge, unlike some algorithm testing.
This test truly pulls out the best knowledge of someone for any React project.

It would be so great if you can hint the result that I need to improve after this challenge.

Even though GPT is allowed, but I'm rarely using them in daily works ...

Thank you again.

## Updated after finished three problems:
### Problem #1
I finished the first two methods in a heartbeat by using `for loop` and `Array.prototype.reduce`.
For the third one after 5 minutes thinking I decided to go with a solution that combined the previous two, which is create a summary and using Array
This problem took me 10 minutes.

### Problem #3
I choose to do this after #1 because this seems to be easier than #2.
I have provided a file with detailed note as much as I can.
For a refactored version, its kinda short because I'm combined it Problem #2.
So in Problem #2 files, you will mostly see my coding's style.
This problem took me 20 minutes

### Problem #2
To be honest, UI & designs it not my advantage.
My advantages are logical and UX.
I never used Vite before, therefore, I'm not applied to this test yet. But I'm happily to learn it or any other new technologies.
I try to use as less library as I can because I wanted to demonstrate as much as possible for this evaluation to be thorough.
This problem took me 6 hours after many refactoring attempts

## Final though
Hopefully we will have a chance to work together. Thanks for reading this.
